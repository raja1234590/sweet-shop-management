How I Used AI

Used ChatGPT for guidance on best practices in backend architecture and validation patterns



Helped debug CSS layout issues and improve UI consistency

Assisted in reviewing code for readability and maintainability



AI significantly improved development efficiency by providing quick guidance and review suggestions.
All core logic, architectural decisions, and final implementations were written and validated by me.
AI was used responsibly as a productivity and learning tool, not as a replacement for development effort.
